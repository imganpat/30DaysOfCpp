# Day 16

This is day 16 of cpp. Today i have created some programs related to string.

## Learnings

1. How string works
1. Use build in functions

## Practicals

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2016%20-%20Sring%20Programs/01_count.cpp) which counts the frequency of a character from the string.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2016%20-%20Sring%20Programs/02_vowels.cpp) which counts the frequency of vowels from the string.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2016%20-%20Sring%20Programs/03_length.cpp) which finds the size or length of string without any build-in functions.

1. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2016%20-%20Sring%20Programs/04_copy.cpp) which copies one string into another without any build-in functions.

1. Created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2016%20-%20Sring%20Programs/05_palindrome.cpp) which checks if a string is palindrome or not.

## Issues faced

1. String reverse got some errors but found the solution on internet.
