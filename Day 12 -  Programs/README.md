# Day 12

This is day 12 of cpp. Today i have created some simple programs from my previous learnings to create my base strong.

## Learings

1. Practical knowledge

## Practical

1. Created [1st Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/01_positive_negative.cpp) which tells if a number is positive, negative or zero.

1. Created [2nd Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/02_even_odd.cpp) which tells if a given number is even or odd.

1. Created [3rd Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/03_max_min.cpp) which tells the maximum and minimun numbers from given 2 numbers.

1. Created [4th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/04_table.cpp) which prints the multiplication table of a number in a formated way.

1. Created [5th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/05_swap.cpp) which swaps the given 2 numbers with and without the use of third varialbe.

1. Created [6th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/06_prev_next_char.cpp) which prints the previous and next character from a given character using ASCII values.

1. Created [7th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/07_vowels.cpp) which checks the given character is vowel or not.

1. Created [8th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/08_area_volume_rectangle.cpp) which prints the area and volume of rectangle according to the given choice.

1. Created [9th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/09_leap_year.cpp) which checks the given year is leap year or not.

1. Created [10th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2012%20-%20%20Programs/10_calculator.cpp) which performs the arthematic operations accoring to the given operation.

## Issues faced

1. In volwes program I have to check the upper case lettors also but it increaed the code so I decided to convert the letter to lowercase üëç.
