# Day 5 & 6

This is day 5 & 6 of cpp or c++. On day 5 I have Learned how to use nested loops and created 7 pattern programs. On day 6 I created more programs with numeric patterns.

## Learnings

1. Nested loops
1. Handle some tricky conditions

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/01_solid_square.cpp) to print print a square filled with "\*".

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/02_right_half_pyramid.cpp) to print a right half triangle or pyramid filled with "\*".

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/03_inverted_right_half_pyramid.cpp) to print a inverted right half pyramid filled with "\*".

1. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/04_full_pyramid.cpp) to print full pyramid filled with "\*".

1. Created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/05_inverted_full_pyramid.cpp) to print inverted full pyramid filled with "\*".

1. Created [6th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/06_left_half_pyramid.cpp) to print a left half pyramid filled with "\*".

1. Created [7th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/07_inverted_left_half_pyramid.cpp) to print a inverted left half pyramid filled with "\*".

1. Created [8th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/08_rhombus.cpp) to print a rhombus filled with "\*".

1. Created [9th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/09_diamond.cpp) to print a diamond filled with "\*".

1. Created [10th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/10_hollow_square.cpp) to print a square which has border of "\*".

1. Created [11th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/11_number_increasing_right_half_pyramid.cpp) to print a pyramid with increaing the values of row numbers.

1. Created [12th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/12_number_triangle.cpp) to print a pyramid with increaing the values of column numbers.

1. Created [13th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/13_floyd_triangle.cpp) to print floyd's triangle.

1. Created [14th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/14_full_number_increasing_pyramid.cpp) to print a full number increasing pyramid.

1. Created [15th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2005%20%26%2006-%20Pattern%20Programs/15_diamond_number_increasing.cpp) to print a diamond with increasing numbers.

## Issues faced

1. Left pyramids were little tricky but found a unique solution just print the square and divide it using its diagonal and we get a left triangleüëç.
