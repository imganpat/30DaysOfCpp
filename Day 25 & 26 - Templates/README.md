## Day 25

THis is day 25 of cpp. Today I have learned about Templates in cpp. It is used to write generic programs.

## Learnings

1. What is Template
1. Need of Template
1. Functional Template
1. Class Template

## Practicals

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2025%20%26%2026%20-%20Templates/01_template.cpp) which uses the concept of functional template. It has a template function which returns the addition 2 numbers whether it is interger or float it can be used for both data types.

2. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2025%20%26%2026%20-%20Templates/02_class_template.cpp) which uses the concept of class template. It has a class which a data member and a method.
   We can pass any datatype for the member it will store and diaplay it.

## Issues Faced

1. I tried to print the type of variable but it dosen't work for strings.
