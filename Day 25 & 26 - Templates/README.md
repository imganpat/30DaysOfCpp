## Day 25 & 26

THis is day 25 & 26 of cpp. Today I have learned about Templates in cpp. It is used to write generic programs.

## Learnings

1. What is Template
1. Need of Template
1. Functional Template
1. Class Template
1. Multi Parameter Template
1. Default Parameter Template

## Practicals

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2025%20%26%2026%20-%20Templates/01_template.cpp) which uses the concept of functional template. It has a template function which returns the addition 2 numbers whether it is interger or float it can be used for both data types.

2. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2025%20%26%2026%20-%20Templates/02_class_template.cpp) which uses the concept of class template. It has a class which a data member and a method.
   We can pass any datatype for the member it will store and diaplay it.

3. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2025%20%26%2026%20-%20Templates/03_multiple.cpp) which uses the concept of multiple parameter template. It shows we can use 2 different datatypes in class templates.

4. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2025%20%26%2026%20-%20Templates/04_deafult.cpp) which uses the concept of default parameter template. It shows how we can use default datatype if not mentioned in a template class.

5. Created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2025%20%26%2026%20-%20Templates/05_sort.cpp) which has a function template to accept array of any data and sorts in acending order.

6. Created [6th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2025%20%26%2026%20-%20Templates/05_square.cpp) which has a class template to accept a number and prints the square.

## Issues Faced

1. I tried to print the type of variable but it dosen't work for strings.

### Thank you.
