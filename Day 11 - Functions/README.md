# Day 10

This is day 11 of cpp. Today I have learned about functions. Basically it is used to do a paricular times with just make a block of code once.

## Learnings

1. Function.
1. Differnce between parameter and arguments.
1. How to pass arguments.
1. Inline function.
1. How to declare default parameters.

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2011%20-%20Functions/01_function.cpp) which shows how to create a simple function and use it.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2011%20-%20Functions/02_parameter_function.cpp) which shows how to pass a argument to a function and work accordingly.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2011%20-%20Functions/03_inline_function.cpp) which shows how to create and use unline functions which improves perfomance when the function task is less.

1. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2011%20-%20Functions/04_default_parameters.cpp) which shows how to give default parameters to a function which can be helpful in various ways.

1. Created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2011%20-%20Functions/05_recursion.cpp) which shows how to create and use recursion functions that reduces the code.

1. Created [6th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2011%20-%20Functions/06_function_overloading.cpp) which shows the concept of function overloading that can be usefull if we want to perform a task but the no. of arguments are not knows to us.

## Issues faced
