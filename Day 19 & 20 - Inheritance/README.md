# Day 19 & 20

On day 19 I have learned the concept of Inheritance and its types and created 2 programs based on my learnings.
On 20 I have created 3 programs.

## Learnings

1. What is Inheritance
1. Single level Inheritance
1. Multi level Inheritance
1. Multiple Inheritance
1. Hirerachical Inheritance
1. Hybrid Inheritance

## Practical

1. Created[1st progran](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2019%20%26%2020%20-%20Inheritance/01_single.cpp) which uses the concept of single inheritance. There are 2 classes in the program 1. Product with 2 members product name and product price and 2nd class Discount which inherits from Product has 1 member discount percentage and basic methods to accept and display the details. There are some add on functions to counts the total price and total dicount according to the given percentage and then returns the discounted price with the saving.

1. Created[2nd progran](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2018%20-%20Constructor%20%26%20Deconstructor/02_paramerterised.cpp) which uses the concept of Multilevel inheritance. It has 3 classes Customer(the Parent class), Depositor(inheriting from Cutomer) and Borrower(inheriting from Depositor) respectively. The Borrower class consists of two bsic methods which initalizes the memebers of all class and the display it.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2019%20%26%2020%20-%20Inheritance/03_multiple.cpp)
   which uses the concept of multiple inheritance.

   It has 3 classes Personel, Academin, Bio-data.
   Personel has private members name, address, email-id, birth date. Academic class has 3 provite mermber 10th marks, 12 marks and class obtained.
   Bio_data class contains 2 public methods which is used to initalise and display the details of both the class.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2019%20%26%2020%20-%20Inheritance/03_multiple.cpp) which uses the concept of multiple inheritance. It has 3 classes: 1. Personel with members which holds personel details, 2. Academic with members which holds accedimic details, 3. Bio_data which accepts the details and prints it.

1. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2019%20%26%2020%20-%20Inheritance/04_hirerachical.cpp) which uses the concept of hirerachical inheritance. It has 3 classes: 1. Employee(parent class) 2. Fulltime(1st child class) 3.Partime (2nd child class) these classes together form a program which accpets some information of the employe amd then prints it.

1. Created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2019%20%26%2020%20-%20Inheritance/05_hybrid.cpp) which uses the concept of hybrid inheritance. It has 4 classes: 1.Rollno 2. Name 3.Marks 4.Student. With the help of these classes we accept the student details and print it.

1. Created [6th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2019%20%26%2020%20-%20Inheritance/06_virtual_base_class.cpp) which uses the concept of virtual base class inheritance. It has 4 classes: 1.Student, 2.2.Acedimic_marks, 3.Extra_marks and 4.Result. There are two functions too which helps to count the total marks obtained and calculates the percentage too.

## Thank you ❤️.
