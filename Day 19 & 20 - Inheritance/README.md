# Day 19 & 20

On day 19 I have learned the concept of Inheritance and its types and created 2 programs based on my learnings.

## Learnings

1. What is Inheritance
1. Single level Inheritance
1. Multi level Inheritance
1. Multiple Inheritance
1. Hirerachical Inheritance
1. Hybrid Inheritance

## Practical

1. Created[1st progran](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2019%20%26%2020%20-%20Inheritance/01_single.cpp) which uses the concept of single inheritance. There are 2 classes in the program 1. Product with 2 members product name and product price and 2nd class Discount which inherits from Product has 1 member discount percentage and basic methods to accept and display the details. There are some add on functions to counts the total price and total dicount according to the given percentage and then returns the discounted price with the saving.

1. Created[2nd progran](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2018%20-%20Constructor%20%26%20Deconstructor/02_paramerterised.cpp) which uses the concept of Multilevel inheritance. It has 3 classes Customer(the Parent class), Depositor(inheriting from Cutomer) and Borrower(inheriting from Depositor) respectively. The Borrower class consists of two bsic methods which initalizes the memebers of all class and the display it.
