# Day 17

This is day 17 of cpp. Today I have learned the basic concepts of OOPs or Object Oriented Programing. From today I am going to start OOPs.

## Learnings

1. What is OOPs.
1. Classes & object.
1. Features of OOPs.
1. Concepts related to OOPs.

## Practical

1. created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/custoomer.cpp) to demonstrate how to declare class and its member and methods also how to create a object of the classes and uuse it.

1. created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/02_static.cpp) to demonstrate the use of static member and method of the class.

1. created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/03_array_object.cpp) to demonstrate the use of static member and method of the class.

1. created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/04_object_parameter_return.cpp) which has a class Distance with 2 members feet and inch and 3 methods 1. to take input from user and initilize the members 2. to display the data and 3. which takes 2 objects as parameter and return the object.

1. created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/05_friend_function.cpp) which uses the concept of friend function to accept 2 product details of the same class and then calculates the total sum of price.

1. created [6th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/06_friend_class.cpp) which uses the concept of friend class to multiply 2 numbers of 2 different classes. Class 2 contains the method to multiply.

1. created [7th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/07_max_array_2_classes.cpp) which has 2 classes Array1 Array2 and find the maximun element of the array from both the classes.

1. created [8th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/08_max_price.cpp) which has a class Product with name and price member; I have created an array of objects of the class and then printed all products and wrote a funtcion to print the details of the product with highest price.

## Issues faced

1. It was quite complicated to write the programs like 8th program; had to struggle for it but finally found the solution and learned many things today üëç.
