1. created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/custoomer.cpp) to demonstrate how to declare class and its member and methods also how to create a object of the classes and uuse it.

1. created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/02_static.cpp) to demonstrate the use of static member and method of the class.

1. created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2017%20-%20Classes%20%26%20%20Objects/03_array_object.cpp) to demonstrate the use of static member and method of the class.
