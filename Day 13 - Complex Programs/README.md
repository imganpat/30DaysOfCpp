1. Logic Building

## Practical

1. Created [1st Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/01_currency.cpp) which takes the amount from the user and print the no. of currency to give back.

1. Created [2nd Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/02_check.cpp) which takes input from the user and check if the input is a number or letter(uppercase/lowercase) or a special character.

1. Created [3rd Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/03_sum_of_digit.cpp) which prints the sum of digits of a given number.

1. Created [4th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/04_sum_1st_last.cpp) which prints the sum of first and last digit of a given number.

1. Created [5th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/05_count.cpp) which prints the count of zeros, even and odd digits of a given number.

1. Created [6th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/06_digit_word.cpp) which prints the digit of a given number in words.

1. Created [7th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/07_prime_no.cpp) which checks if the given number is prime number or not.

1. Created [8th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/08_perfect_no.cpp) which checks if the given number is perfect number or not.

1. Created [9th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/09_armstrong_no.cpp) which checks if the given number is perfect number or not.

1. Created [10th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2013%20-%20Complex%20Programs/09_armstrong_no.cpp) which checks if the given number is palindrome number or not.
