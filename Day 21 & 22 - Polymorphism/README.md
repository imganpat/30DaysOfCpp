# Day 20 & 21

Today I have learned the concept of Polymorphism and created one project

## Learnings

1. What is Polymorphism
1. Compile Time Polymorphism
1. Run Time Polymorphism
1. Function Overloading

# Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2021%20%26%2022%20-%20Polymorphism/01_function_overloading.cpp) which uses the concept of function overloading. It has 3 functions with same name area() with different parameter to achieve the overloading.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2021%20%26%2022%20-%20Polymorphism/02_operaator_overloading.cpp) which uses the concept of operator overloading. It adds 2 objects of same class and stores the result in 3rd object.
