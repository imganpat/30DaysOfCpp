# Day 21 & 22

I have learned the concept of Polymorphism and created some project
On day 21 learned compile time polymorphism and created 2 programs
On day 22 learned run time polymorphism and created 2 programs

## Learnings

1. What is Polymorphism and its uses
1. Compile Time Polymorphism
   1. Function overloading
   1. operator overloading
1. Run Time Polymorphism
   1. This pointer
   1. Virtual function

# Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2021%20%26%2022%20-%20Polymorphism/01_function_overloading.cpp) which uses the concept of function overloading. It has 3 functions with same name area() with different parameter to achieve the overloading.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2021%20%26%2022%20-%20Polymorphism/02_operaator_overloading.cpp) which uses the concept of operator overloading. It adds 2 objects of same class and stores the result in 3rd object.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2021%20%26%2022%20-%20Polymorphism/03_this.cpp) which uses the concept of this pointer. It users 2 object of same class and finds the minimun of then and stores into 3rd object.

1. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2021%20%26%2022%20-%20Polymorphism/04_virtual_function.cpp) which uses the concept of virtual functions. It uses a base class Conversion with 3 drived classes Weight, Volume, Currency with same methods name and accesses by a pointer of type base class to convert the units and display them.
