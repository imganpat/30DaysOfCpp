# Day 23 & 24

This is the 23 day of cpp. Today I have learned how to handle external files using cpp.

## Learnings

1. File operations
1. How to read and write a file
1. How to append a file

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/01_basic.cpp) which shows how to open write and read a file.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/02_append.cpp) which shows how to update a file.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/03_eof.cpp) which shows how to read multiple lines from a file using eof() function.

### Thank you.
