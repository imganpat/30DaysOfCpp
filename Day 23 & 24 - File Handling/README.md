# Day 23 & 24

This is the 23 day of cpp. Today I have learned how to handle external files using cpp.

## Learnings

1. File operations
1. How to read and write a file
1. How to append a file

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/01_basic.cpp) which shows how to open write and read a file.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/02_append.cpp) which shows how to update a file.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/03_eof.cpp) which shows how to read multiple lines from a file using eof() function.

1. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/04_newspaper.cpp) which accepts 'n' newspaper details and stores it into a text file. It also uses the OOPs methodology.

1. Created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/005_student.cpp) which reads the Name, 3 Marks of the students from a [text file](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/05_student_read.txt) and then calculates percentage and stores it into [another](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/05_student_percentage.txt) file.

1. Created [6th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2023%20%26%2024%20-%20File%20Handling/06_positive_negative.cpp) which takes 10 numbers as input and checks if the number is negative or positive and then stores the data into negative and positive text files.

## Issues faced

1. getline() function was not behaving normally so found the solution on chatgpt.
