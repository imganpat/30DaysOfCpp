# Day 27

This is day 27 of cpp. Today I have learned about the STL(Standard Template Library) library.

## Learings

1. What is STL and why to use it.
1. Containers
   1. Vectors

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2027%20-%2030%20-%20STL/01_vector.cpp) which uses the concept of vectors.

### Thank You.
