## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2027%20-%2030%20-%20STL/01_vector.cpp) which uses the concept of vectors.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2027%20-%2030%20-%20STL/02_list.cpp) which uses the concept of list.
