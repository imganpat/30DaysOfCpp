# Day 2

This is day 2 of cpp or c++. Today I have learned different data types, comments, input/output methods and variable scopes.

## Learnings

1. Constants.
1. Various datatypes.
1. Commentss.
1. How to accept input from user.
1. Local and Global scope.
1. How to access variable with scope resolution operator.
1. Manipulators.

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2002/01_constant.cpp) to see how a constant variable and a normal variable behaves during execution .

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2002/02_datatypes.cpp) to demonstrate the use of various data types.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2002/03_io.cpp) to accept values from user and display them.

1. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2002/04_global.cpp) to see how we can create and access a global variable inside any function which may have the same name as global variable.

1. Created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2002/05_manipulators.cpp) to see how we can format the ouput or see the use of manipulators.

## Issues faced

1. As I am learning git also so I faced issues regaring git while pushing the files on github; found the solution on a quora post.
