# Day 10

This is day 10 of cpp. Today I have learned about pointers and the concept of dynamic memory allocation using pointers.

### Update

I have started using github copiolt for faster coding as I am learing other technologies too.

## Learnings

1. Pointers.
1. Dynamic memory allocation.

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2010%20-%20Pointers/01_pointer.cpp) which shows how to create a pointer and use it to store the address of a variable and access it with '\*'.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2010%20-%20Pointers/02_dynamic.cpp) which shows how to allocate the memory of a variable at runtime and deallocate it.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2010%20-%20Pointers/03_dynamic_array.cpp) which shows the use of enum basically it is used to numberize some collection of data.

## Issues faced

No issues faced üëç.

### Thank You‚ù§Ô∏è.
