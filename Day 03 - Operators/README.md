# Day 3

This is day 3 of cpp or c++. Today I have learned Operators in c++ and created some programs with it.

## Learnings

1. Arthematic operators (used for mathematical calculations).
1. Assignment operators (used to assign values to a variable).
1. Pre and Post increment decrement (used to increment or decrement a variable by 1 unit).
1. Comparision operator (used to compare two or more values).
1. Logical operator (used to compare more then one condition).

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2003%20-%20Operators/01_arthematic.cpp) to demonstrate how we can use arthematic operators and perform mathematical operations in the program.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2003%20-%20Operators/02_assignment.cpp) to perform various assignment operations which is used to assign a value to a variable.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2003%20-%20Operators/03_increment_decrement.cpp) which perform pre and post increment-decrement operations.

1. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2003%20-%20Operators/04_comparision.cpp) which performs all the comparision operations with number.

1. Created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2003%20-%20Operators/05_logical.cpp) which performs logical operations.
