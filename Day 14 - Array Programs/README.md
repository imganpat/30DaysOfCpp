# Day 14 & 15

This is day 14 of cpp. Today i have created some programs related to array.
On day 15 I created some program of 2d array or matrices.

## Learnings

1. How array works
1. How matrix works

## Practical

1. Created [1st Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/01_sum.cpp) which accepts array elements from the user and prints the sum of all array elements.

1. Created [2nd Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/02_max_min.cpp) which accepts array elements and prints the maximum and minimum array element present in the array.

1. Created [3rd Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/03_sort.cpp) which accepts array and sort it in ascending and descending order.

1. Created [4th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/04_occurence.cpp) which prints the sum of first and last digit of a given number.

1. Created [5th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/05_union.cpp) which accepts elements of 2 array and prints the union of both arrays.

1. Created [6th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/06_intersection.cpp) which accepts elements of 2 array and prints the intersecton of both arrays.

1. Created [7th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/07_matrix_sum.cpp) which accepts elements of 2-D array or matrix and prints the sum of all elements of that matrix.

1. Created [8th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/08_matrix_add.cpp) which accepts elements of 2 matrix and prints the addition of both matrix.

1. Created [9th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/09_matrix_multiplication.cpp) which accepts elements of 2 matrix and prints the multiplication of both matrix.

1. Created [10th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/10_upper.cpp) which accepts elements of a matrix and calculates the sum of the upper triangular elements of that matrix.

1. Created [11th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/11_lower.cpp) which accepts elements of a matrix and calculates the sum of the lower triangular elements of that matrix.

1. Created [12th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/12_diagonal.cpp) which accepts elements of a matrix and calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of that matrix.

1. Created [13th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/13_sum_rows_cols.cpp) which accepts elements of a matrix and calculates the sum of each row and column of that matrix.

1. Created [14th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/14_transpose.cpp) which accepts a matrix and prints transpose of that matrix.

## Issues faced

Multiplication of 2 matrix was little confuding and struggled a lot and found the solutionüëç.
