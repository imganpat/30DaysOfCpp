# Day 14

This is day 14 of cpp. Today i have created some programs related to array.

## Learnings

1. How array works

## Practical

1. Created [1st Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/01_sum.cpp) which accepts array elements from the user and prints the sum of all array elements.

1. Created [2nd Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/02_max_min.cpp) which accepts array elements and prints the maximum and minimum array element present in the array.

1. Created [3rd Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/03_sort.cpp) which accepts array and sort it in ascending and descending order.

1. Created [4th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/04_occurence.cpp) which prints the sum of first and last digit of a given number.

1. Created [5th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/05_union.cpp) which accepts elements of 2 array and prints the union of both arrays.

1. Created [6th Program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2014%20-%20Array%20Programs/06_intersection.cpp) which accepts elements of 2 array and prints the intersecton of both arrays.
