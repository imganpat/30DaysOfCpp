# Day 9

This is day 9 of cpp. Today I have learned about some more data types.

## Learnings

1. Structure.
1. Unions.
1. Difference between structure and union.
1. Enums.

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2009%20-%20Structures%2C%20Unions%2C%20Enums/01_structure.cpp) which shows how to declare a structur and how to use and access its members with(.operator). The size of structur is the sum of total sizes of each variable of that structure.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2009%20-%20Structures%2C%20Unions%2C%20Enums/02_union.cpp) which shows how to use unions and they store only one value at a time and the size of union is the size of that member variable with largest size among all the members variables of that union datatype.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2009%20-%20Structures%2C%20Unions%2C%20Enums/03_enum.cpp) which shows the use of enum basically it is used to numberize some collection of data.
