# Day 9

This is day 9 of cpp. Today I have learned about some more data types.

## Learnings

1. Structure.
1. Unions.
1. Difference between structure and union.
1. Enums.

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2009%20-%20Structures%2C%20Unions%2C%20Enums/01_structure.cpp) which shows how to declare a string variable and use it with simple cin.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2008%20-%20String/02_string2.cpp) which shows how to declare a string variable and use it with getline().

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2008%20-%20String/03_string_functions.cpp) which shows the use of string function.

## Issues faced

1. Reversed function was not working after some research on c++ official website I found that the algotithm header file is used for it üëç.
