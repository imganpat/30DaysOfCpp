# Day 1

This is day 1 of cpp or c++. Today I have learned some basics of the language form internet.

## Learnings

1.  History of c++.
1.  Difference between c and c++.
1.  Why we need it.
1.  Basic structure of c++.
1.  Variables in c++ and how to use them.
1.  Rules to declare a variable.

## Practical

1. Created a simple [hello world program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2001/first.cpp) with c++ in turbo c as recommended by myj college teacher but later switched to vs code.
1. Created one more [program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2001/variable.cpp) to see how a variable works.

## Issues faced

1. As it was my first day and the programs was easy so didn't face any major issues.

1. I just faced issue during installation process of c++ compiler and found solutions on the internet.

1. At firstly I wrote my code on turbo c it worked but when I switched to vs codeI faced some errors regaring the header files and fixed it with some research on stackoverflow.
