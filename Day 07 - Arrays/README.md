# Day 7

This is day 7 of cpp. Today I have learned about arrays

## Learnings

1. What is array.
1. Types of array(1-dimentional, 2-dimentional and multi-dimentional).
1. How it is stored in the memory.
1. How it is accessed by index which starts with 0.

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2007%20-%20Arrays/01_1d_array.cpp) which shows how an array is declared, initialized and printed.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2007%20-%20Arrays/02_2d_array.cpp) which shows how an 2-dimentional array is declared, initialized and printed.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2007%20-%20Arrays/03_multi-dimentional.cpp) which shows how an multi-dimentional array is declared, initialized and printed.

## Issues faced

1. multi-dimentional array was little tricky took a pen and paper to underatand clearly üëç.
