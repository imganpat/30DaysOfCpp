# Day 4

This is day 3 of cpp or c++. Today I have learned Control structures in c++, how to control the flow of the program and created some programs with it.

## Learnings

1. Loop Statements
   1. for loop
   1. while loop
   1. do-while loop
1. Conditional Statements
   1. if statement
   1. if-else statement
   1. if-elseif-else statement
   1. switch statement
1. break statement
1. continue statement

## Practical

1. Created [1st program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2004%20-%20Control%20Structure/01_forloop.cpp) to demonstrate how we can use for loop for iterations of code.

1. Created [2nd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2004%20-%20Control%20Structure/02_whileloop.cpp) to demonstrate how we can use while loop for iterations of code.

1. Created [3rd program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2004%20-%20Control%20Structure/03_do-whileloop.cpp) to demonstrate how we can use do-while loop for iterations of code.

1. Created [4th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2004%20-%20Control%20Structure/04_if.cpp) to demonstrate how we can use if statement to check a condition in the program and takes actions accordingly.

1. Created [5th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2004%20-%20Control%20Structure/05_if-else.cpp) to demonstrate how to handle program if the given if condition gets false and skip it and execute else block.

1. Created [6th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2004%20-%20Control%20Structure/06_if-elseif-else.cpp) to demonstrate how to handle mutiple conditions in a program. If if conditions gets false it checks to another else if block until it finds the else block .

1. Created [7th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2004%20-%20Control%20Structure/07_switch.cpp) to demonstrate how to handle multiple conditions with switch statement; its an alternate for if-else ladder.

1. Created [8th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2004%20-%20Control%20Structure/08_break.cpp) to demonstrate how to get out of loop according to a condition.

1. Created [9th program](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2004%20-%20Control%20Structure/09_continue.cpp) to demonstrate how to skip a perticular iteration count for a specific condition.

## Issues faced

1. In continue program I faced some issues it was little confusing so I had to give time for debugging and finally solved itüëç.
