# Day 18

Today I have learned the concept of constructor and deconstructor and created some programs.

## Learnings

1. Default constructor
1. Parameterised constructor
1. Copy constructor
1. Deconstructor

## Practical

1. Created[1st progran](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2018%20-%20Constructor%20%26%20Deconstructor/01_default.cpp) which uses the concept of default constructor. It initalises the class members with some data when we created the object of the class.

1. Created[2nd progran](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2018%20-%20Constructor%20%26%20Deconstructor/02_paramerterised.cpp) which uses the concept of paramerterised constructor. It initalises the class members with the data provide by the user when we created the object of the class.

1. Created[3rd progran](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2018%20-%20Constructor%20%26%20Deconstructor/03_default_para.cpp) which uses the concept of paramerterised constructor with default parameters. It initalises the class members with the data provide by the user and a default value when we created the object of the class.

1. Created[4th progran](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2018%20-%20Constructor%20%26%20Deconstructor/04_copy.cpp) which uses the concept of copy constructor. It initalises the class members with another object's data when we created the object of the class.

1. Created[5th progran](https://github.com/imganpat/30DaysOfCpp/blob/main/Day%2018%20-%20Constructor%20%26%20Deconstructor/05_deconstructor.cpp) which uses the concept of copy constructor. It initalises the class members with another object's data when we created the object of the class.

## Thank you ❤️.
